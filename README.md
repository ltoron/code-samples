Samples of code written by me

SoberSabesVibration_.m shows the Matlab analysis code for the second experiment of my masters project.
This was an experiment using a robotic manipulandum (vBOT). Some of the code refers to vBOT functions, which I cannot share.

SoberSabesModel.m is an implementation of previously existing Python code that I translated to Matlab. 
The part of the code where I create an overview of different simulations in one plot was added by me.
This is also part of my masters project.

PythonTHA_LauraToron1013107.py shows the Python code for a small experiment I programmed for a class.
